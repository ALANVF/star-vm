# StarVM

StarVM is a portable virtual machine for the [Star programming language](https://github.com/ALANVF/Star-lang-specification).

Things to note:
- This is not at all finished
- This is most likely only going to be used for bootstrapping, although I may keep it around afterwards if it's good
- I like bulleted lists
- Idk how most of this dune stuff works ._.


## Wait what happend to using Pascal?

Would love to continue using Pascal, but OCaml is just *so* much easier to work with.
I might go back to Pascal at some point if I feel like OCaml isn't good enough, but this is what I've got for now.
